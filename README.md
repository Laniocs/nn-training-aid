# Aid for Training Neural Networks for Object Classification
Here are some Programs which might help you train and using a RetinaNet or a YOLOv2. For this I used the "keras-retinanet" Library. It is essential that you install it properly before you use the program "Website"
* Fotostation(Node.js V8.12.0) - Creates a server. You can take Fotos with any device and it will be uploaded on this server. Tested on Android
* Website-Dev - When you place Images in the imgs/imgsToClassifiy folder, you can annotate them via Browser
* GreenScreen - Generate an artificial Dataset. You need png Images with transparent Background and images as Backgrounds
* toCSV - Translate .xml annotations into one .csv annotation
* Website - When configured properly (classify.py got copied in the keras-retinanet-master folder, the weights got copiet in the keras-retinanet-master/snapshots folder and in routs.js and classify.py the Path got changed) you can visit this Website, upload your Image and it will be classified.
